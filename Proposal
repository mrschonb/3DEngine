3D Graphics Engine in c++

The intent of this project is to create a functional 3D engine in c++ that is capable of reading
3D filetypes, namely .obj, and displaying them on the screen. This is achieved through the creation
of 3 main struct types (mesh, triangle, object) which work in unision to create any specified object.
In order to create 3D objects in a 2D screen matrix math is imperative. Matrixes are used to translate 
points in 3D space to points in 2D space in a dynamic way. They are also to be utilized to rotate objects
in space in order to show off their different sides and angles. If there is enough time, the project will
include a very simplistic lighting and shadow system that uses will most likely use shadow mapping and not
raytracing or raycasting to skip shadow calculations.
The project will not include any form of GUI due to time restrictions and will only display objects fed
to it directly through code or throught the cli. 

Conecepts employed in the project
Dynamic memory will be used to store 3D objects of unkown size.

Pointers will be used all throughout the project to handle data

Threads will be used to render multiple objects on the screen at once,
or to do multiple matrix calculations at once without causing rendering slowdown
